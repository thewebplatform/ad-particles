# Atomic Design : Particles

This is SASS Module that defines a base set of variables that can used as a
standard in component styling & consistent theming. Particles, although not
originally discussed by Atomic Design creator Brad Frost, are the abstract &
configuration structures that shape the Atomic design structure from the ground
up.
